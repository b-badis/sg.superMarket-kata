# sg.superMarket-Kata

The problem domain is something seemingly simple: pricing goods at supermarkets.

Some things in supermarkets have simple prices: this can of beans costs $0.65. Other things have more complex prices. For example:

three for a dollar (so whatâ€™s the price if I buy 4, or 5?)
$1.99/pound (so what does 4 ounces cost?)
buy two, get one free (so does the third item have a price?). 
The exercise is to experiment with various models for representing money and prices that are flexible enough to deal with these (and other) pricing schemes
